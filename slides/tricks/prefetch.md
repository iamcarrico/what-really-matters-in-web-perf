## Prefetch

* dns-prefetch
* prefetch
* prerender

Note:
DNS Prefetch will grab a DNS name from the get-go, useful for secondary domains that will be used (e.g. CNDs or other assets-holding domains). Prefetch will grab certain resources right away. I have used this for logos, to ensure they do not block when they are needed. Also, prerender will grab entire pages. On iamcarrico.com, this is used for the first blog post, as it is usually the first link people click.
