## Web Page Test

* One-off tests <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Comparisons <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Private instances <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* CI integration <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Web Page Test is by far one of my favorite tools. It can be used for one-off tests, from a variety of browsers and locationsâ€” WPT can do everything. We also use it often to do comparisons, by checking changes that we want to make to the codebase, and see what the effects are.

We also use a private instance for some larger internal tests that we are constantly running. It is _incredibly_ easy to create a WPT private instance on a Amazon server.
