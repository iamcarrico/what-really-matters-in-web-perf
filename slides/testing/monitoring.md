## Monitoring

* SpeedCurve <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* SOASTA <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* NewRelic <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Google Analytics <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Etc <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
There are a huge amount of tools that are available to monitor your sites. At Vox Media, we have been using both an internal tool, and SpeedCurve to be constantly watching our sites. SOASTA and NewRelic both have their own products that can be used. Even Google Analytics has some base data that can be looked at.
